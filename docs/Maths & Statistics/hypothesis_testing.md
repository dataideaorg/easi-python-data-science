1. What is the primary purpose of inferential statistics?
   - A. To describe the main features of a dataset
   - B. To draw conclusions about a population based on a sample
   - C. To organize and summarize data
   - D. To determine the reliability of data

2. Which of the following is an example of a parameter?
   - A. Sample mean
   - B. Sample standard deviation
   - C. Population mean
   - D. Sample variance

3. Which statistical test is used to compare the means of two independent groups?
   - A. Paired t-test
   - B. Independent t-test
   - C. ANOVA
   - D. Chi-square test

4. A Type I error occurs when:
   - A. A true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected
   - B. A false null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected
   - C. A true null hypothesis is incorrectly accepted
   - D. A false null hypothesis is incorrectly accepted

5. The p-value represents:
   - A. The probability that the null hypothesis is true
   - B. The probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true
   - C. The probability of making a Type I error
   - D. The power of the test

6. Which of the following is true about the confidence interval?
   - A. It provides the exact value of the population parameter
   - B. It indicates the range within which the sample mean will fall 95% of the time
   - C. It provides a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall
   - D. It determines the sample size needed for a study

7. What is the central limit theorem?
   - A. The distribution of sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of the population, given a sufficiently large sample size
   - B. The sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed
   - C. The probability distribution of a continuous random variable will be normal if the sample size is large enough
   - D. The mean of a large sample will equal the mean of the population

8. When should you use a chi-square test?
   - A. To compare the means of more than two groups
   - B. To test the association between two categorical variables
   - C. To compare the variances of two samples
   - D. To analyze the relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable

9. If the 95% confidence interval for a mean difference includes zero, what does this imply?
   - A. The difference is statistically significant
   - B. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected
   - C. The sample size is too small
   - D. The p-value is less than 0.05

10. The power of a statistical test is:
    - A. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
    - B. The probability of accepting the null hypothesis when it is false
    - C. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false
    - D. The probability of making a Type I error

11. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is:
    - A. A statement of no effect or no difference
    - B. A statement that there is an effect or a difference
    - C. Always the hypothesis that the researcher wants to prove
    - D. Less important than the alternative hypothesis

12. The sample statistic that is most commonly used to estimate a population parameter is called:
    - A. Estimator
    - B. Point estimate
    - C. Confidence interval
    - D. Hypothesis

13. Which method is used to determine the sample size for a study?
    - A. Power analysis
    - B. T-test
    - C. Chi-square test
    - D. Correlation coefficient

14. The F-test in ANOVA is used to:
    - A. Test for the equality of two variances
    - B. Test for the equality of three or more means
    - C. Test for the equality of proportions
    - D. Test for independence between two categorical variables

15. Which of the following is true regarding the normal distribution?
    - A. It is skewed to the right
    - B. It is defined by its mean and standard deviation
    - C. It can only take on positive values
    - D. It is bimodal
