25. Given a date as a triplet of numbers (y, m, d), with y indicating the year, m the
month (m = 1 for January, m = 2 for February, etc.), and d the day of the month, the
corresponding day of the week f (f = 0 for Sunday, f = 1 for Monday, etc.) can be found as
follows:
```

(e) let f 1 = d + a + b + 1
(t) let f = f 1 mod 7
(g) stop.
```
Write a program that will read a date and print the corresponding day of the week. All divisions
indicated above are integer divisions.


```python
# your solution
```

26. Write a program to input a series of positive integers and determine whether they are
prime. The program should terminate if a negative integer is given as the input. A prime
number is a number that is divisible by only one and itself. However one is not considered a
prime number.


```python
# your solution
```

27. Write a program to find out whether a given number is a perfect number. The program
should terminate if a negative integer is given as the input. A perfect number is a number
whose factors other than itself add up to itself.


```python
# your solution
```

28. Write a program to find and display the minimum and the maximum among 10
numbers entered from the keyboard. Use a single-dimensional array to store the numbers
entered. The numbers can be non-integers. An example would be as follows:
```
Enter 10 numbers: 5 7.8 9.6 54 3.4 1.2 3 7 8.8 5
Minimum = 1.2
Maximum = 54
```


```python
# your solution
```

29. Suppose there are 4 students each having marks of 3 subjects. Write a program to
read the marks from the keyboard and calculate and display the total marks of each student.
Use a 2D (two-dimensional) array to store the marks. An example would be as follows:
```
Enter the marks of four students, on four rows:
50 60 80
60 75 90
30 49 99
66 58 67

Total marks of four students:
190
225
178
191
```


```python
# your solution
```

30. Write a program to read in two matrices A and B of dimensions 3×4 and 4×3
respectively, and compute and display their product AB (of dimensions 3×3). Assume that the
elements of the matrices are integers. Use functions to while implementing this program.


```python
# your solution
```
